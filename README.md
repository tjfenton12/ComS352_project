# ComS352_project
Shell project for ComS352

To compile this project please type: <make>

To run this project please open two terminals.
type: <./tcp_server> in one terminal and execute it, then
type: <./tcp_client> in the other and execute it

from the terminal running the client you can type standard shell commands and you will see their output

BUGS:
1) Sometimes you must repeat commands to ensure they go through.
2) when you execute commands, sometimes the previous commands text will still appear after the current command's output is displayed.
	this is often prevelant when running a command like "grep --help" followed by "ls"
